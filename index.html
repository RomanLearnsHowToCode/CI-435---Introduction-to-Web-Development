		</header>
<p>End of semester 1, finishing website, testing & evaluation</p>
<p>1. Testing and evaluation<br/>
In order to create a website which will comply with my semester 1 coursework criteria I had to make sure that my website is responsive, accessible, well written, without HTML or CSS errors and also in correct grammar. And that it comply with ethics and legal law and also copyright law. I used many tools to prove that my website is well working, images or media I used are optimized and a website is working how it should on each browser and behave correctly.</p>
<p>2. Code validation: improving CSS code</p>
<p>3. Cleaning of HTML and CSS code</p>
<p>4. Finishing coursework</p>

			<h3>Week 10: CSS position property</h3>
			<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-12-03"><strong>December 3, 2018</strong></time></p>
		</header>
<p>Lecture about CSS and also talking about coursework</p>
<p>1. Normal flow HTML document<br/>
Elements are displayed in the order in which they are written in the HTML, we can also change or arrange them to show in a different order with CSS. Block level elements start on a new line, while inline elements are nested within block elements.</p>
<p>2. Float and Clear properties<br/>
The CSS float and clear properties are used to take an element out of normal flow and position it to the right or left of its containing (parent) box, the element that follows around the floated element until the clear property ends the float.</p>
<p>3. Position property - static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky<br/>
CSS position property is way how to remove elements from normal flow and position them anywhere on the page. There is also an amazing puzzle solving game, which can help a student to learn and understand CSS positioning: <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com.">Flex box froggy game</a></p>
<p>4. Offset properties - top, right, bottom, left</p>
<p>5. Z-index property<br/>
The z-index property controls the stacking order of elements. Whether elements stay on top or lay behind other elements. The z-index value is an integer.</p>
<p>6. Common use cases for the position property</p>
<p>7. CSS3 colour - RGBA, Alpha channel<br/>
CSS colour can be specified by both: key-words or 6 digit hexadecimal code. There is a tool from Adobe Creative Cloud to help us with colour choice and code. <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">Colour Wheel</a></p>
<p>8. Browser support<br/>
Macromedia Dreamweaver comes with a tool, to help us optimize our website or preview it in different browser support, it can help us to debug or set different rules in CSS for better user experience.</p>

			<h3>Week 9: HTML5 and CSS3 forms</h3>
			<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-11-26"><strong>November 26, 2018</strong></time></p>
		</header>
<p>Lecture about form markup and styling</p>
<p>1. Role of forms on websites<br/>
There are various types of forms for a website, we can use them for engaging users, collecting data from them, they can be used for e-commerce (shopping cart, orders, and payments), blogs (comments, content management), e-gov. (vehicle licensing, council tax, student finance), survey (obtaining information, user experience, comments) HTML form elements.</p>
<p>2. Styling forms with CSS<br/>
Since each platform and browser style forms differently, it is more than important to style forms with CSS3 to over-ride browser/platform default style. Especially form controls like buttons, checkboxes.</p>
<p>3. Short introduction to JavaScript, PHP, ASP.net<br/>
In the second semester we will be introduced to JavaScript and other languages which will help us, to make forms responsive and fully working.</p>
<p>4. HTML input types<br/>
There is a wide variety of input types. We can input text, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit button etc. Each has got different function and also the different setting.</p>
<p>5. Styling the button element</p>

		</header>
<p>CSS3 responsive layout</p>
<p>1. Basic layout properties(float, clean and position)<br/>
Web page content is presented in the order in which it is marked up in HTML document unless the normal flow is disrupted by CSS declaring layout properties. In CSS we can set rules for various tags and elements, we can even createnew classes.</p>
<p>2. Review of RWD core techniques</p>
<p>3. CSS3 layout modules<br/>
CSS3 has 3 modules for layout: Grid layout (Layout in 2 dimensions in both columns and rows), Multi-column layout (To split content into columns) Flexible box layout (Layout in one dimension – either in columns or rows). Each layout have it cons and pros. They are also suitable for different purpose.</p>
<p>4. Content-led design - media query breakpoints<br/>
We should first write the content of our website, then work on a design. Media queries should be written in the style sheet, so it will override the default style.</p>
<p>5. How to hide elements<br/>
Sometimes we want to hide content. There are multiple ways how to hide content with style sheet elements, some hidden elements will still affect layout, so we have to pick the right code option.</p>

			<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-11-12"><strong>November 12, 2018</strong></time></p>
		</header>
<p>Lecture about flexible media</p>
<p>1. Copyright<br/>
I had to write quite a lot about Copyright in the past few weeks during my Digital Accelerator Course, we have been told what files we can use and when under what rules. We have been also told what is ethic and legal rules.</p>
<p>2. RWD -3 core techniques.<br/>
Core techniques to master are Fluid layout – using relative units to size elements, then CSS media queries – to detect screen widths, viewport sizes, and media. Last core technique is responsive media.</p>
<p>3. Image basics (HTML or CSS?)<br/>
The HTML code for images which have some informative content, and we need to add some description or alternative text to make our website also accessible. The CSS code for images which are in the background, like dots I used as background for my banner.</p>
<p>4. Media in responsive web pages<br/>
Everything about images, accessibility, sizes, and names.</p>
<p>5. RWD workflow - how different grid areas should be organised.<br/>
More details about workflow and grid layout from the previous week.</p>

			<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-11-05"><strong>November 5, 2018</strong></time></p>
		</header>
<p>Intro to Responsive Web Design(RWD) - media queries.</p>
<p>1. Introduction to RWD.<br/>
After some interesting information about how people approach websites these days, we have been introduced to Responsive Web Design, it means that our website will behave and display in a different way, but correctly at various devices.</p>
<p>2. The viewport meta element.<br/>
The viewport attribute for the meta element allows the mobile device viewport to be set to a specific width. With this meta element, we can set values for different displays.</p>
<p>3. CSS3 media queries such as syntax, breakpoints and testing.<br/>
CSS3 media queries are what make the web page responsive. I understand it as a way to check what width of display user have and use grid layout suitable for that device. Testing is very easy, upload website to a server and enter it from various devices.</p>
<p>4. Learning Journal - CSS grid layout workflow (design wireframe).<br/>
The grid layout is how many columns and rows will each device show, and how content will be organized (for example aside can be written in code as a second selector after nav but we can set it to display in a different order.)</p>

			<h3>Week 5: The CSS box</h3>
			<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-10-29"><strong>October 29, 2018</strong></time></p>
		</header>
<p>Model and measurement of CSS and styling text.</p>
<p>1. The cascade - "specificity".<br/>
The cascade is how browsers determine which rule or rules apply to which element – and how to handle conflicts between rules. The browser style sheet is a default, an external style sheet over-rides browser CSS because you set rules for it.</p>
<p>2. CSS box model.<br/>
Controls how elements are displayed and positioned on a web page, every HTML element is treated as if it is a box. Boxes can be organized in a sequence, one after another, or be nested within other boxes. There are block and inline levels of boxes.</p>
<p> 3. CSS - absolute and relative lenght units.<br/>
Absolute units are inches, centimeters, millimeters, points. Relative units are screen pixels, percent, root element font size, element font size, viewport width. And each unit has got different values and behavior.</p>
<p>4. Block and inline elements.</p>
<p>5. Viewport percentage lenghts (vw,vh).<br/>
Viewport-percentage lengths define the length of an element relative to the size of the viewport, the visible portion of the web page.</p>

			<h3>Week 4: Cascading Stylesheet</h3>
			<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-10-22"><strong>October 22, 2018</strong></time></p>
		</header>
<p>In fourth lecture we started with CSS.</p>
<p>1. What is CSS?<br/>
Cascading style sheet is a declarative language for specifying the presentation of HTML elements by a browser. So how do I understand this statement? Well CSS is a very useful tool (code), which can help us to with stylisation of our whole website by one file. With CSS you can set rules for each section of code, create new classes etc.</p>
<p>2. CSS syntax - rules, properties and values<br/>
Elements are objects in the HTML document. CSS rules target elements in order to instruct the browser, how to present content.CSS consist of a number of rules. A rule consist of two parts, the selector which targets an HTML element and one or more declarations, inside curly braces, state how the element will be displayed. A declaration also has two parts, a property – positon, color, margin etc. And a value for the property – e.g. margin: 1.2em </p>
<p>3. Selectors<br/>
Selectors are targets of elements, for example caption, time, img, h1-h6</p>
<p>4. Attaching an external stylesheet to all web pages<br/>
Each web page must have in head tag link for stylesheet, each web page can be linked to different stylesheet, but it is better to keep website consistent to avoid confusion and misread for user.</p>
<p>5. Emedded and inline CSS.</p>
<p>6. Type, Class, Id and pseudo-class selectors.</p>
<p>7. Normalize.css - what is it, how does it works, how to link it with website.</p>

			<h3>Week 3: HTML5</h3>
			<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-10-15"><strong>October 15, 2018</strong></time></p>
		</header>
<p>Document structure & hypertext</p>
<p>1. Section elements, and why HTML 5 is easier and better to write.<br/>
HTML5 document starts with doctype declaration at a very first line of webpage document. HTML5 is easier for web designers to write, and brings new functions. We don’t need to write div for each section elements anymore.</p>
<p>2. Index.html document object model.<br/>
The structure of section elements in meaning full order. Ex. Footer is at the bottom of a page, and a header is on the top, even though you can display sections in a different order with CSS grid layout, it is a rule how website/page should be written.</p>
<p>3. Div elements - how did they changed with HTML 5 and where to use them.<br/>
Used only in order to mark-up grouped content in a document in order to style these elements with CSS properties.</p>
<p>4. Absolute and relative links, when, why and how to use them.<br/>
The way how I understand absolute and relative links is that with an absolute link you give complete destination of an object, while a relative link is often used only in the local website, for example, to link an image from the different directory.</p>
<p>5. What is viewport, how to set it correctly for multiple devices.<br/>
A viewport is an optimization tool for website, to display content for multiple devices in order we want.</p>
<p>6. Anchor tags.<br/>
The anchor tag is to link together two separate but related pages or pieces of information. Can link internal link, local link, an external link or email link.</p>
